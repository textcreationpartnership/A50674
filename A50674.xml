            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving received a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in my thoughts of that Chriſtian-like Moral, <hi>Non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ſolum natiſumus, ſed partem Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, partem Amici, pariem Patria vendicant;</hi> I thereupon begun ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excogitate how I might lay out that ſmall Talent which the Lord hath lent me, to the profit and good of my Country: and taking notice of the Quotidian enmities, Contentions, and Quarrels, which ariſe amongſt men about the Deviſes, Bequeſts and Legacies of their dead Friends, which moſt commonly happens by reaſon of the vitious penning of their Wills and Teſtaments, and is chiefly occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the ſcarceneſs of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on this Subject in our Engliſh Tongue; there being very few Books in the ſame Language ſave Mr. <hi>Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornes</hi> excellent Treatiſe Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb facs="tcp:95621:3"/>
which is now almoſt out of Print, and can hardly be gotten at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stationers; and beſides, the price thereof doth exceed many honeſt Countrymans purſe; and ſo many men are left in miſts of ignorance, by reaſon whereof their Wills and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments are often ſo ſtrangely drawn, with ſo many dubious, knotty, and ſometimes nonſenſical Clauſes and Sentences therein, as that often the Teſtators meaning can ſearcely, and ſometimes not at all be found out; whereupon it happens that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Bequeſts and Deviſes are voyd, and ſo the Legataries looſe that which was intended them: otherwhiles they are forced to ſue for their Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whenas Doubts a riſe upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators words and meaning in his Will, and then often the Remedy proves worſe then the Diſeaſe, and more Charges ſpent in the Law for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Legacy, then ſometimes it is worth: Therefore, that my honeſt Countrymen may be partly informed

in ſome particulars how they may diſpoſe of their Eſtates at their deaths, and that they may make their Wills according to Law, ſo that their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and meanings may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and wreſted to a wrong ſence after their Deaths, and thoſe who were intended and expected to reap benefit by the Teſtators death, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of their juſt Rights and Dues; I have thereupon taken the pains to collect ſeveral Caſes and Reſolutions out of the Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, and Canon-Laws, and alſo out of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Common-Laws, and Statutes of this Realm touching Wills and Teſtaments, their ſeveral ſorts and forms, what ſhall be a good Will, who may make one, and who may be an Executor, and of the ſeveral ways of appointing them; and alſo touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tutors, Childrens Portions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, and Legacies; together with the Probat of Wills, paſſing Accounts, payment of Mortuaries; and of the power of the Ordinary in granting of

Every Teſtament is a laſt Will, but every laſt Will is not a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for a laſt Will is a general word, and agreeth to every ſeveral kinde of laſt Will, or Teſtament; but it's properly to be called a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when an Executor is named: for by the naming an Executor, it differeth from the reſt. <hi>Franc.

               <p n="4">4. Now as to the formal making of a Solemn Teſtament, many things are requiſite by the Civil Law. As 1. That there be ſeven Witneſſes preſent at the making thereof. 2. They muſt all be required to be there on purpoſe: for it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if they were there onely by chance, and unrequeſted. 3. Every Witneſs muſt ſubſcribe his Name with his own hand, if he can write, or elſe two or three others for him. 4. The Teſtator with his own hand alſo muſt write his own Name, and the Name of him whom he will have to ſucceed him, and have all his goods; and if the Teſtator cannot write, then he muſt name the party (that ſhall ſucceed him) before the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. 5. The Witneſſes muſt be ſuch as are not prohibited in that behalf.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95621:7"/>
6. The Witneſſes muſt ſee and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Teſtator, and not hear him onely; and the Witneſſes alſo muſt ſeal the Teſtament, either with their own, or the ſeal of ſome other. And laſtly, the Teſtament muſt be finiſhed at one time, without any Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, except natural, ſuch as cannot be avoided: And if any of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars be wanting, then it is reputed for a ſolemn Teſtament; but here in <hi>England,</hi> we are not neceſſarily tyed to obſerve this ſtrict form of making our Teſtaments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For with us it is ſufficient, if the Teſtator do appoint his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and declare his Will before two or three Witneſſes, whoſe probation of the ſame, as concerning the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of an Executor, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Goods and Chattels, is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

are: for whereas in other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments the former is revoked by the latter, and that <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any expreſs revocation; yet by the Civil Law a Teſtament among Children is not revoked by a latter Teſtament, wherein ſtrangers are preferred, unleſs it be mentioned and revoked by expreſs words; or unleſs the latter Teſtament be made <hi>ad pias Cauſas,</hi> or elſe ſome great Diſpleaſure or Enmity have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt the Father and Children, or ſome like cauſe have come to paſs, whereby it may be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Father did repent him of the making of the ſaid Will. And laſtly, another priviledge belonging to this Teſtament, is, That if there be no Witneſſes to prove the ſame, yet if the Teſtament be found among other Writings in the Teſtators Cheſt, or like place, and undoubtedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be written or ſubſcribed with the Teſtators own hand, or by him procured to be written by ſome other;
